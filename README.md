# 📊 ML-Based Trading Signal Generator

> A real-world application of Machine Learning in Financial Markets — predicting short-term price movement based on technical indicators.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores how **machine learning** can be applied to stock market data to make intelligent trading decisions.  
We use historical price data combined with widely-used **technical indicators** (like MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Garman-Klass volatility) to train models that can:

- Predict whether a stock’s price will go up or down
- Forecast the next day's closing price
- Analyze volatility shifts over time

It’s an experimental yet practical attempt to mimic real-world quantitative trading systems — using Python and open-source tools.

## 🧠 Features

- 📈 Automatic calculation of popular **technical indicators** using `pandas_ta`
- 🔍 Supports both **classification** (directional movement) and **regression** (next price)
- 🛠️ Feature engineering based on OHLCV + volatility formulas
- 🤖 Machine Learning with scikit-learn (`RandomForest`, `LogisticRegression`)
- 📊 Feature importance visualization
- 💾 Clean and reproducible data pipeline

## 📈 Technical Indicators Used

- **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- **RSI** (Relative Strength Index)
- **Bollinger Bands** (Upper/Lower bands)
- **ATR** (Average True Range)
- **Garman-Klass Volatility**
- (And more can be added easily)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-trading-project.git
cd ml-trading-project
````

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the notebook or scripts:

```bash
# Run notebook (preferred for experimentation)
jupyter notebook notebooks/ML_Trading_Experiment.ipynb

# Or run training script
python src/model_train.py
```

## 💡 Example Use Case

Using indicators from the past 20 days, the model predicts:

> “Will the stock price go up tomorrow?”
> or
> “What is the next expected close?”

Based on the prediction, the system could simulate a basic **buy/sell strategy** or flag high-probability trade setups.
